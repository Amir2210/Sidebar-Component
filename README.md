🎉 Welcome to the Sidebar Components! 🚀

These React components, Home and Sidebar, are essential parts of a user interface designed to provide navigation and interaction features. Let's explore their functionality and usage!

📦 Tech Stack:
* React.js
* AppContext (Custom Context)

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
Home Component:
* Sidebar Toggle: Clicking the sidebar toggle button (<FaBars />) toggles the visibility of the sidebar.
* Modal Display: Clicking the "show modal" button triggers the display of a modal dialog.

Sidebar Component:
* Dynamic Links: Renders navigation links dynamically based on data provided in the links array.
* Social Media Icons: Displays social media icons with links to external platforms from the social array.

💭 Process:
* Component Integration: Integrated the Home and Sidebar components into a React application using a global context.
* State Management: Utilized custom context (AppContext) to manage the state of the sidebar's visibility.
* Dynamic Rendering: Dynamically rendered navigation links and social media icons using data from predefined arrays.

📚 Learnings:
* Gained experience in managing global state using React context for better component communication.
* Practiced dynamic rendering of elements based on data arrays, improving component reusability.
* Enhanced understanding of event handling and UI interaction patterns in React applications.

✨ Improvements:
While the current version of the components is functional, there are opportunities for improvement:

* Styling Enhancement: Improve the visual design and layout for better aesthetics and user experience.
* Accessibility: Ensure accessibility standards are met for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
* Responsive Design: Implement responsive design principles to ensure compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.
